Math 1205-001 Project, Fall 2021 semester

-----------------------------------
This project is a rough simulation of how an 80/ principle often occurs. 
It simulates a row of cells in a petri dish, each of which may pseudo-randomly be fed a sugar. 
Upon being fed, the cell will grow. As each cell gets larger in diameter, it becomes more likely to receive the next sugar drop.



To any developers who stumble across this project, please note that I am an amateur developer. Please forgive the abysmal documentation and clunky spaghetti code. I may return to this project in the future to clean it up.

HOW TO RUN
The main user interface is in client.java. It runs the primary method in DemoScript.java which (hopefully) describes how a simulation runs. It should be able to run in any JDE using Java 11 (I think).
